**Top10 Notebook**\
In the first Jupyter notebook called Top10.ipynb, the top 10 causes of calls to 311 have been analyzed for the zip code '10025'. The total number of incidents of each of these 10 types have also been calculated for the year 2020. The output variable called top10 is a pandas.Series which is in descending order by number of incidents, and contains as its labels the incident type (a string) and the associated values the total number of incidents of this type in 2020.

**Parking Notebook**\
In the second Jupyter notebook called Parking.ipynb, we analyze whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in the ZIP code '10025' than they are in general. Specifically, we calculate the total number of parking incidents in our ZIP, and the total number of all incidents. We have assigned our answer to a single bool variable called `higher_parking_proportion` which is True if the ZIP code 10025 contains a higher proportion of parking incidents than the global value, and False otherwise. For instance, if there were 300 parking incidents in 10025, and 1000 total incidents in 10025, a rate of 30%, but the global parking incident rate was 4000 parking incidents out of 10000 total, a ratio of 40%, we would assign higher_parking_proportion a value of False.'
